### youtube is filled with LIES
you dont need squarespace. dont let these youtubers mislead you. you dont even need to buy hosting. 

### caveats
- this isn't gonna teach you html, css or how to use git. i can make a video on that tho and i'll link it when i do. also you are a big girl who can google.
- imma be real with you. i pay 12 bucks a year for this this website but you dont have to. that's just cause i am a brand and wanted it to be matty316.com. if you dont care about a domain name, this is completely free (if you consider being a slave to microsoft free lol). 

### tr:dr
1. make a [github](https://github.com) account 
2. create a repo and name it <your_username>.github.io (for example mine is called [matty316.github.io](https://github.com/matty316.github.io))
3. push an index.html file to the repo. put some html in that hoe
4. go to <your_username>.github.io (it may take a sec to deploy) 
5. you have a website but now go make it pretty. i use [bulma.io](https://bulma.io) for css.
### checkout the [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) website for more detail instructions
